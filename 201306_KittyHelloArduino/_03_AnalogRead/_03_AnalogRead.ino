  Analog In, LED and Serial Out

  Behavior: 
  Reads an analog input on indicated pin, prints the result to the serial 
  monitor.
  
  Circuit:
  * Pin 3: LED, anode to microcontroller, 330 Ohm resistor from 
    cathode to ground
  * Pin A0: Attach one lead of a photocell to 5V and another to a 10k Ohm 
    resistor that is connected to ground. Connect the Arduino sensor pin to
    the photocell lead that is also attached to the 10k Ohm resistor.
